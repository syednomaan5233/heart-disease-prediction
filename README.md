# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes using machine learning models.

It demonstrates skills in EDA, feature selection, and classification algorithms.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)  
- Records: ~300  
- Features:age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, max heart rate, etc. 

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Scaled features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps
3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
